* Everything in this project isn't perfect because it contains "spaghetti code", but you can find a better project on github.Â 
* DO NOT USE ANY STACKOVERFLOW KEYS IN THIS OR YOUR SIMILAR PROJECT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY WORK... THEY CAN ASK U SOME WEIRD QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS FUNCTION IS ****ING WORKING, WHAT ITS PURPOSE IS, AND SOMETHING ELSE. WATCH OUT !
